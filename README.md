# Linear-Programming
Linear Programming is a mathematical technique for maximizing or minimizing a linear function of several variables, such as output or cost.
Linear programming is often used in business to maximize profit or minimize cost. The first step in solving linear programming problems is to set up a objective function that represents cost, profit, or some other quantity to be maximized or minimized subject to the constraints of the problem. Then we have to define the constraints with a system of linear inequalities. The solution of these systems of inequalities is called the feasible solution. Graph the inequalities to determine the coordinates of the vertices of the region to get the feasible region. Evaluate the function at each vertex. The largest and smallest of those values are the maximum and minimum values of the function, respectively.
